# Computer Graphics
This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Computer Graphics. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. Beizer Curve
2. Bitmap Character Generation
3. Boundary Fill (4 connected)
4. Boundary Fill (8 connected)
5. Bresenham Line Drawing Algorithm
6. Cone Sutherland Line Clipping Algorithm
7. DDA Line drawing algorithm
8. Flood Fill (4 connected)
9. Flood Fill (8 connected)
10. Midpoint Circle Generation Algorithm
11. Midpoint Ellipse Generation Algorithm
12. Plot a Pixel
13. Scal Line
